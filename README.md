### Description

A web application were people can upload images and save them in their local environment. `views` was made with tailwind, php and mysql.

2. Inside http://localhost/dashboard/ go to phpMyAdmin, create a database and create a table named views with the following structure:
   ![Sample Table](./assets/sample-table.png)
3. Inside **config/database.php** pass the correct information for every variable.
4. Check the database conection by inspecting index.php inside your browser.A verification string should be logged if everything went ok.
